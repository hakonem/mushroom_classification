# Mushroom classification
## Kaggle project

This notebook uses the cleaned data set provided by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/mushroom-dataset/data

The aim is to produce a model which accurately classifies mushrooms as edible (class 0) or poisonous (1).

The following models are explored and the performance metrics compared:

**1. Logistic Regression** with different decision thresholds and class weighting   
**2. SVM**   
**3. Random Forest**

Random Forest performs the best, scoring 99% on all the performance metrics.
